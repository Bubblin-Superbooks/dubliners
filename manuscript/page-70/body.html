<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker&rsquo;s widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer, but it was after eight o&rsquo;clock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
