While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if returning to some former remark of his:</p><p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer ... there was something uncanny about him. I&rsquo;ll tell you my opinion....&rdquo;</p><p>He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery.</p></div> </div>
