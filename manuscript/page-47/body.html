<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;All right! All right!&rdquo;</p><p>When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers&rsquo; shops musty biscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster&rsquo;s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each. Refreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the Dodder.</p></div> </div>
