<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A crape bouquet was tied to the door-knocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape. I also approached and read:</p><p>July 1st, 1895 The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine&rsquo;s Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years. R. I. P.</p><p>The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor.</p></div> </div>
