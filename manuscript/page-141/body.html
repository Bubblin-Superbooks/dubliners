<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs Mooney was a butcher&rsquo;s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her father&rsquo;s foreman and opened a butcher&rsquo;s shop near Spring Gardens. But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business. One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour&rsquo;s house.</p></div> </div>
