His wife put him to bed while Mr Power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in. The children&mdash;two girls and a boy, conscious of their father&rsquo;s helplessness and of their mother&rsquo;s absence, began some horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their accents, and his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs Kernan entered the kitchen, exclaiming:</p><p>&ldquo;Such a sight! O, he&rsquo;ll do for himself one day and that&rsquo;s the holy alls of it. He&rsquo;s been drinking since Friday.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
