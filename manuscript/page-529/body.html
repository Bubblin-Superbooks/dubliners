Only the mill was there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Out from the mansion of his forefathers,&rdquo; continued Gabriel, &ldquo;he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy&rsquo;s statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
