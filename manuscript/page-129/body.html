His face was heated. To appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the table. The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. The girl brought him a plate of grocer&rsquo;s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a fork and his ginger beer.

When he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of Corley&rsquo;s adventure.</p></div> </div>
