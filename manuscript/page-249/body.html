Soon they were all quite merry again and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they were all very good to her.</p><p>At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs. Mrs Donnelly said &ldquo;Do, please, Maria!&rdquo; and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria&rsquo;s song.</p></div> </div>
