<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine together that evening in SÃ©gouin&rsquo;s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who was staying with him, were to go home to dress. The car steered out slowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers. They walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening.</p><p>In Jimmy&rsquo;s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A certain pride mingled with his parents&rsquo; trepidation, a certain eagerness, also, to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue.</p></div> </div>
