She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame.</p><p>The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter.
