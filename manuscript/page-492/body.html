<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia&rsquo;s&mdash;Arrayed for the Bridal. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without looking at the singer&rsquo;s face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia&rsquo;s face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the cover.</p></div> </div>
