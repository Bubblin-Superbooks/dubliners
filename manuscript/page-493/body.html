<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just telling my mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That&rsquo;s the truth. Upon my word and honour that&rsquo;s the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so ... so clear and fresh, never.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
