He had the body taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance.</p><p>Constable 57E corroborated.</p><p>Dr Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head had been injured in the fall. The injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart&rsquo;s action.</p></div> </div>
