He goes in to represent the labour classes. This fellow you&rsquo;re working for only wants to get some job or other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, the working-classes should be represented,&rdquo; said the old man.</p><p>&ldquo;The working-man,&rdquo; said Mr Hynes, &ldquo;gets all kicks and no halfpence. But it&rsquo;s labour produces everything. The working-man is not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and cousins. The working-man is not going to drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
