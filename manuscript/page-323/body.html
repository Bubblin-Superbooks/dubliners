<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Parnell,&rdquo; said Mr Henchy, &ldquo;is dead. Now, here&rsquo;s the way I look at it. Here&rsquo;s this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey. He&rsquo;s a man of the world, and he means well by us. He&rsquo;s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him. He just says to himself: &lsquo;The old one never went to see these wild Irish. By Christ, I&rsquo;ll go myself and see what they&rsquo;re like.&rsquo; And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit? Eh? Isn&rsquo;t that right, Crofton?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
