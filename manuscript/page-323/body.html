<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I was just telling them, Crofton,&rdquo; said Mr Henchy, &ldquo;that we got a good few votes today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who did you get?&rdquo; asked Mr Lyons.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward of Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too&mdash;regular old toff, old Conservative! &lsquo;But isn&rsquo;t your candidate a Nationalist?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a respectable man,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in favour of whatever will benefit this country. He&rsquo;s a big ratepayer,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn&rsquo;t it to his own advantage to keep down the rates? He&rsquo;s a prominent and respected citizen,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn&rsquo;t belong to any party, good, bad, or indifferent.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the way to talk to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
