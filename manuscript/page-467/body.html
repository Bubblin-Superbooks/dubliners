They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Julia?&rdquo; asked Aunt Kate anxiously. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing.
