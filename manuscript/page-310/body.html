I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. &lsquo;And how do you like your new master, Pat?&rsquo; says I to him. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t much entertaining now,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Entertaining!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;He&rsquo;d live on the smell of an oil-rag.&rsquo; And do you know what he told me? Now, I declare to God I didn&rsquo;t believe him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
