Upon my word it was magnificent, the style of the oratory. And his voice! God! hadn&rsquo;t he a voice! The Prisoner of the Vatican, he called him. I remember Crofton saying to me when we came out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Mr Power.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course he is,&rdquo; said Mr Kernan, &ldquo;and a damned decent Orangeman too. We went into Butler&rsquo;s in Moore Street&mdash;faith, I was genuinely moved, tell you the God&rsquo;s truth&mdash;and I remember well his very words. Kernan, he said, we worship at different altars, he said, but our belief is the same. Struck me as very well put.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
