And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn&rsquo;t do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn&rsquo;t for Maria.

From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes; from the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things. She would be there before eight. She took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words A Present from Belfast. She was very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers.</p></div> </div>
