For her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her daughter&rsquo;s honour: marriage.</p><p>She counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Mr Doran&rsquo;s room to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt sure she would win. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the others. If it had been Mr Sheridan or Mr Meade or Bantam Lyons her task would have been much harder. She did not think he would face publicity. All the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had been invented by some. Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years in a great Catholic wine-merchant&rsquo;s office and publicity would mean for him, perhaps, the loss of his job.</p></div> </div>
