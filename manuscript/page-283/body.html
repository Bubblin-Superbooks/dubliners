They had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of doors.</p><p>Mr O&rsquo;Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in the lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked.</p></div> </div>
