All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in the chapel. Only for Father O&rsquo;Rourke I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;d have done at all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the Freeman&rsquo;s General and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor James&rsquo;s insurance.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
