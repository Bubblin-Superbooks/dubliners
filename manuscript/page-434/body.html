<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr Cunningham and Mr Kernan. In the bench behind sat Mr M&rsquo;Coy alone: and in the bench behind him sat Mr Power and Mr Fogarty. Mr M&rsquo;Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others and, when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks. As these had not been well received he had desisted. Even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus. In a whisper Mr Cunningham drew Mr Kernan&rsquo;s attention to Mr Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and to Mr Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward.</p></div> </div>
