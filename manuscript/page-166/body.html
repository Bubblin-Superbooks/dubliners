<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> something in Ignatius Gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out at elbows and at his wits&rsquo; end for money he kept up a bold face. Little Chandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher&rsquo;s sayings when he was in a tight corner:</p><p>&ldquo;Half time now, boys,&rdquo; he used to say light-heartedly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my considering cap?&rdquo;</p><p>That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn&rsquo;t but admire him for it.</p><p>Little Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could do nothing in Dublin.</p></div> </div>
