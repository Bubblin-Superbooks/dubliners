He said that the happiest time of one&rsquo;s life was undoubtedly one&rsquo;s schoolboy days and that he would give anything to be young again. While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent. Then he began to talk of school and of books. He asked us whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Lytton. I pretended that I had read every book he mentioned so that in the end he said:</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,&rdquo; he added, pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, &ldquo;he is different; he goes in for games.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
