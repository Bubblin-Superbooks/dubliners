I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why should I be ashamed of myself?&rdquo; asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m ashamed of you,&rdquo; said Miss Ivors frankly. &ldquo;To say you&rsquo;d write for a paper like that. I didn&rsquo;t think you were a West Briton.&rdquo;</p><p>A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel&rsquo;s face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque.</p></div> </div>
