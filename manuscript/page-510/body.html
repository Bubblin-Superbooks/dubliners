Gabriel&rsquo;s wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt Julia&rsquo;s making and she received praises for it from all quarters. She herself said that it was not quite brown enough.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,&rdquo; said Mr Browne, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m brown enough for you because, you know, I&rsquo;m all brown.&rdquo;</p><p>All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding.</p></div> </div>
