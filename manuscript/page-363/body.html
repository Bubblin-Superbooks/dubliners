<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.</p><p>All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner were Mr Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr O&rsquo;Madden Burke. Mr O&rsquo;Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney&rsquo;s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The baritone was asked what did he think of Mrs Kearney&rsquo;s conduct. He did not like to say anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men. However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came.</p></div> </div>
