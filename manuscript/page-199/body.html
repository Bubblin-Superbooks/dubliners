He began to stammer:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.... He ... he began to cry.... I couldn&rsquo;t ... I didn&rsquo;t do anything.... What?&rdquo;</p><p>Giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring:</p><p>&ldquo;My little man! My little mannie! Was &rsquo;ou frightened, love?... There now, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma&rsquo;s little lamb of the world!... There now!&rdquo;</p><p>Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child&rsquo;s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.</p></div> </div>
