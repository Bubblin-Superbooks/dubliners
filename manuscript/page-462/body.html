<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he&rsquo;s all right, and don&rsquo;t let him up if he&rsquo;s screwed. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s screwed. I&rsquo;m sure he is.&rdquo;</p><p>Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins&rsquo; laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a relief,&rdquo; said Aunt Kate to Mrs Conroy, &ldquo;that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he&rsquo;s here.... Julia, there&rsquo;s Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
