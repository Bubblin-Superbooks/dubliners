Kindly attend to what I say and not to what Mr Shelley says, sir. You have always some excuse or another for shirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening I&rsquo;ll lay the matter before Mr Crosbie.... Do you hear me now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you hear me now?... Ay and another little matter! I might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you. Understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How many courses do you want, I&rsquo;d like to know.... Do you mind me, now?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
