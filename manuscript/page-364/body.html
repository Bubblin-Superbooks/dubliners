Mrs Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.</p><p>They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn&rsquo;t be fooled. If they didn&rsquo;t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes.</p></div> </div>
