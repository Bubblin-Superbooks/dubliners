Christmas-time!&rdquo; said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.</p><p>The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl&rsquo;s bitter and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better.</p></div> </div>
